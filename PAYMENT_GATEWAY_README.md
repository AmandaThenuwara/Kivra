# Payment Gateway Implementation

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive payment gateway component for the Kivra e-commerce application with the following features:

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Step Checkout Process**
- **Step 1: Cart** - View cart items and proceed to shipping
- **Step 2: Shipping Details** - Enter shipping information with validation
- **Step 3: Payment** - Complete payment with card details or Amazon Pay

### 2. **Payment Methods Supported**
- **Credit/Debit Cards** (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover)
- **Amazon Pay** integration

### 3. **Card Validation Features**
- **Real-time card type detection** (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.)
- **Luhn algorithm validation** for card number verification
- **Expiry date validation** (checks for valid format and future dates)
- **CVV validation** (3 digits for most cards, 4 for Amex)
- **Cardholder name validation**

### 4. **Form Features**
- **Real-time formatting** for card numbers (spaces every 4 digits)
- **Automatic expiry date formatting** (MM/YY)
- **Input restrictions** (numbers only for card/CVV, letters for names)
- **Error messages** with clear validation feedback

### 5. **Billing Address**
- **Option to use shipping address** as billing address
- **Separate billing address form** when needed
- **Province dropdown** for Sri Lankan provinces

### 6. **Security Features**
- **Input sanitization** and validation
- **Secure payment processing simulation**
- **SSL security indicators**
- **Card type icons** and visual feedback

### 7. **User Experience**
- **Step indicator** showing current progress
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Loading states** during payment processing
- **Success/error handling** with user feedback

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`/components/Payment.jsx`** - Main payment gateway component
2. **`/components/Payment.css`** - Comprehensive styling for payment forms

### Modified Files:
1. **`/pages/Cart.jsx`** - Updated to integrate multi-step checkout
2. **`/pages/Pages.css`** - Added checkout steps and shipping form styles
3. **`/pages/ProductDetail.jsx`** - Fixed to use CartContext properly

## Key Validation Functions

### Card Number Validation
- Luhn algorithm implementation
- Card type detection (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- Real-time formatting with spaces

### Expiry Date Validation
- MM/YY format validation
- Future date checking
- Current month/year validation

### CVV Validation
- 3 digits for most cards
- 4 digits for American Express
- Real-time input restriction

## Usage

The payment gateway is fully integrated into the cart checkout flow:

1. **Add items to cart** from product pages
2. **View cart** and proceed to checkout
3. **Enter shipping details** with full validation
4. **Complete payment** with credit card or Amazon Pay
5. **Receive confirmation** with transaction details

## Payment Flow

```
Cart → Shipping Details → Payment Gateway → Success
  ↑                                             ↓
  ←← Back navigation available at each step ←←
```

## Security Considerations

- No actual card details are stored
- Payment processing is simulated
- Input validation prevents malicious data
- SSL security indicators for user trust

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Additional payment methods (PayPal, Google Pay, etc.)
- Saved payment methods for returning customers
- Enhanced fraud detection
- International shipping and currency support

The implementation provides a production-ready foundation that can be easily extended with real payment processing services.
